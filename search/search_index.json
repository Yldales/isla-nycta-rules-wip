If you feel you were unfairly banned, create a ticket here \u2060\u27a5pot-counter-reports. The following will net you an immediate 24 hour ban:</p> <ul> <li>Mass killing (3+ bodies)</li> <li>Combat Logging/Logging out with bleed (unless utilizing &lt;#747745677915848754&gt; to report someone rule breaking) </li> </ul> <p>Racist/homophobic/sexist/etc comments will be an Indefinite Ban from all Isla Nycta servers and Discord if applicable. The punishment for this is often without a warning as we expect people to have common sense when it comes to these kinds of infractions. </p> <p>Every month, your offenses are reviewed to see if a mark against you will be removed. Should your ban be lifted and you receive another Indefinite Ban, it will become a Permanent instead and will not be appealed. Even if you manage to get a clean slate from the monthly removals of kicks the second punishment of an Indefinite Ban will be Permanent.</p> <p>Please go to \u2060\u27a5pot-counter-reports and search for your Alderon ID to see if you've received a kick. Should you find your ID and have no recollection of the kick, please create a ticket. There you'll be able to get a complete run down of your offenses and have a chance to contest them, no matter how old the kick might be.</p>"}]}
